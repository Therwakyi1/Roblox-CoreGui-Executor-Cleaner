# Roblox-CoreGui-Executor-Cleaner
This script is made to clear your CoreGui of injected scripts AND your executor. Best used on mobile.

Guaranteed to work on these executors below:
1. Codex
2. Trigon [ Android ]
3. Delta
4. Fluxus Z [ Untested ]
5. Arceus X
6. Vega X
7. KRNL [ Discontinued ]

With that, enjoy V2 of my script!
 Contact me at @j5vz on Discord if you want to use this in your own script.
